Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle projects of any size with speed and efficiency. 

I learned that it works by creating a local repository on the user's machine, which mirrors the central repository. 

Changes are tracked through commits, which record snapshots of the project.

Branching allows parallel development, and merging integrates changes. 

Git uses: the working directory, the staging area, the local repository and the remote repository. 

This setup allows for robust collaboration, with features like conflict resolution, rollback, and efficient handling of non-linear development workflows.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Challenges: Several errors when navigating between stage and remote repo, that were resolved with ChatGPT

New things learned: Git commands: Git add, Git commit, Git clone,  etc.

Looking forward to use what I learned.
